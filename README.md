# Development of a React Frontend Application Using NASA APIs

## Introduction
This project focuses on developing a modern and interactive React frontend application that integrates with NASAâ€™s public APIs. It aims to creatively utilize data for providing insightful astronomy information while showcasing skills in frontend development, API integration, and deployment.

## Technologies and Tools Used
- *Frontend*: React.js with functional components
- *Language*: JavaScript (ES6+)
- *CSS Framework*: Bootstrap for a sophisticated and responsive design
- *API Requests*: Axios for making API calls
- *Testing Frameworks*: Jest and React Testing Library
- *Hosting*: Deployed on a free platform (e.g., GitHub Pages)

## Installation and Setup
1. *Clone the Repository*:
   
   git clone [repository-link]
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**:
   
   cd [project-directory]
3. *Install Dependencies:*:
   
   npm install
4. **Run the Development Server:**:
   
   npm start

## Usage
- *Explore NASA Data*: Access daily or historical astronomy-related information from NASA's public APIs.
- *Responsive UI*: Enjoy a consistent user experience across devices.

## API Integration
- *Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD)*: Fetches the latest daily astronomical images and detailed explanations. Users can explore previous APODs as well.
- *Earth Observatory Natural Event Tracker (EONET)*: Displays natural events detected on Earth.
- *Mars Rover Photos*: Provides captivating images captured by the Mars rovers, offering an in-depth view of the Martian landscape.
- *NASA Image and Video Library*: Accesses NASA's extensive archive of high-resolution images and videos covering various missions, celestial bodies, and technological advancements.

## Testing
- *Unit Tests*: Jest is used for component-level unit testing, ensuring isolated pieces of code function as intended.
- *Integration Tests*: React Testing Library helps verify that critical features and components interact correctly.
